Its purpose is to ensure that House operations and related activities are adequately supported.  The current system for managing the scheduling of over 200 volunteers is manual and paper-based.\r\n\r\nRMHP-Homebase was developed in Spring 2015 by a 4-student team at Whitman College.  It replaces the House's manual scheduling system by an on-line system that is easy to use and learn.  The software has been deployed and is in full use, allowing the organization to focus more fully on client service. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
