      <p>The Ronald McDonald House in Providence (RMHP) serves the Rhode Island community by providing nearby lodging and meals for families of children who are patients at Women &amp; Infants', Hasbro Children's and Rhode Island Hospitals.<br>
Volunteer scheduling is a central activity of RMHP.  Its purpose is to ensure that House operations and related activities are adequately supported.  The current system for managing the scheduling of over 200 volunteers is manual and paper-based.</p>

<p>RMHP-Homebase was developed in Spring 2015 by a 4-student team at Whitman College.  It replaces the House's manual scheduling system by an on-line system that is easy to use and learn.  The software has been deployed and is in full use, allowing the organization to focus more fully on client service. </p>
